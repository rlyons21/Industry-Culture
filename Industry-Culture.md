Set-Up-To-Fail Syndrome:

	In the examples I don't believe that either the bosses or the subordinates acted out of ill-will.
	The bosses wanted to help employees perform better, while the employees wanted their bosses to have
	more confidence in their abilities. 

	Both parties are to blame in these situations. More communication could have resolved 
	most of the issues. This is especiialy true in the expample of Steve and Jeff. Steve could have 
	asked for the reasoning behind the reports, instead of assuming Jeff lacked confidence in his 
	work. On the other hand, Jeff could have explained the importance of the reports when he 
	intially assigned them, or when Steve turned in the poorly written ones. 

	I believe that communication is key in every type of relationship. Lack of communication
	can destroy any relationship, while good communication is vital for maintaining a healthy one.


Diversity in Tech:

	A:

	I knew that white males represented a larger portion of the tech industry, however, I did not realize 
	that the gaps between other groups are so large. I also thought that black males would represent a 
	signifacntly larger portion. The number of black women in the industy surprised me, I did not expect
	their numbers to be that low. 

	I think that part of what contributes to the large gap between white workers in this industry and 
	other ethnicities is that white indiviuals make up more than half of the US's population. 



	B:

	Representation in managment for the tech industry is similar to the general tech workforce. Males 
	consume almost all of the management positions. White males specifically dominate this area. 
	Asians and white females come next, but there is a very big gap between these groups and white males. 
	All other ethnicities are severly under represented, if they are represented at all.

	In previous jobs that I have had, management positions were mostly held by other white individuals.
	However, this made no difference to me. What mattered most to me was that they were qualified, hard
	working, motivated, and respectful of others.


The Other Side of Diversity:

	Baker faced many unnecessary conflicts throughout her career in the tech industry. She held many 
	positions in a variety of cities. I find it remarkable that she found the strength to continue down 
	the path she chose, reguardless that she was not properly respected on many occassions. She could 
	have given up and chosen a different career path, but instead she kept pushing forward.

	New employees should expect some changes when beginning a new job. You may be expected to work more 
	hours, or be entering a stricter environment than before. Also, the dynamics of one team will more 
	than likely vary from other teams, so new employees should be flexible in these aspects. 

	However, a new employee should not have to pretend to be something they are not. You should not have 
	to entirely change your personality or personal beliefs to fit in and be accepted by your co-workers. 


Blind Hiring:
	
	I do not believe that blind hiring is a sufficient solution to addressing industry biases alone. This 
	process may help reduce biases during the hiring process, however, minorities will still face many
	of the same problems after they are hired. The same biases will still exist. This process allows people to
	still keep their preconceived ideas about different groups of people.

	On the other hand, blind hiring might have the potential to solve diversity issues after all. 
	If blind hiring allows minorities a better chance at getting a job, then the tech industry should 
	become more diverse. It would probably take some time, but being exposed to more minorities would allow
	people to change their ideas about other groups of people. The more exposure to something, allows for greater
	understanding. 

	Affirmative action makes it easier to bring diversity to a company. It forces hiring managers to
	find the best candidates that belong to minority groups. However, it does not guarentee you will 
	be hiring the best person for the job. Blind hiring allows a persons skills to be the primary
	basis for whether an idividual will get the job. This process should result in the most qualified 
	candidate getting the job.
